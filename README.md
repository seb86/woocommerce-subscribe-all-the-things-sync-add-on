This is an add-on extension for [WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things](https://github.com/Prospress/woocommerce-subscribe-all-the-things) currently in development.

> Please note: This extension is currently in development.

The goal of the extension is to allow you to synchronise the subscriptions billing period per subscription scheme. Requires [this push request](https://github.com/Prospress/woocommerce-subscriptions/pull/1630) to be applied in order for extension to work.

This works with all supported product types in WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things.

# Current Issues
* ~~Sub-total is incorrect. Possibly due to the sync date day.~~ Fixed! :smile:
* Cart table item total is showing syncronising date twice. e.g. 40,00 â‚¬ every Tuesday every Tuesday. **Only with Bundled Products**
* Recurring Total is showing correct for first renewal but shows the following week also and for free. Quantity of the only item in cart is one. **Only with Bundled Products**
