Allows you to synchronise the subscriptions billing period per subscription scheme.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to synchronise the subscriptions billing period per subscription scheme.

WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things is a mini-extension for [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) that provides experimental subscriptions support for non-subscription product types. It allows you to attach subscriptions to Simple products, Variable products, [Composite Products](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/), [Product Bundles](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) and [Mix and Match Products](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/).

= Requirments =
 * [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) 2.3 or newer.

 * [WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things](https://github.com/Prospress/woocommerce-subscribe-all-the-things) v1.1.0+
 * A staging or test site, I do not recommend using this on live sites yet.
 * A sense of adventure as the codebase is still pre-beta.

To offer this to your customers:

2. Click the **Subscriptions** tab in the **Product Data** meta box
